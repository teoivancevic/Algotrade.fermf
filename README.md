This repository contains the solution developed by the FERMF team for the Algotrade Hackathon. The hackathon was organized by [xFER](https://xfer.hr/), the Informatics Club of FER students, and the Financial Club (FK).

## About the Algotrade Hackathon

The Algotrade Hackathon is a project initiated by xFER and FK. It's designed as a hackathon with the target audience being students of FER and the Faculty of Economics. The task to be solved is related to the field of arbitrage and trading.

Before the competition, students attend thematic lectures over four days, gaining knowledge and competencies in both fields - economics and technology. The lectures are conducted by esteemed economists and industry professionals.

The hackathon follows the lectures, where teams are given a task to solve using the newly acquired knowledge and personal experience. The task is simple to understand but extremely difficult to optimally solve. Teams have a certain amount of time to devise and implement a solution, and at the end of the competition, they present their solutions.
